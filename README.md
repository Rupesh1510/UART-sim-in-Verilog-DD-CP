# UART-sim-in-Verilog-DD-CP
This is the repo of my course project of the subject digital design. this code is written in Verilog. Here in this project I have simulated Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) Protocol in Verilog with specification as following: 
•	8 data bits 1 start bit 1 stop bit with no parity bit 
•	Baud rate & Speed = 115200 bits/s  
•	Clock frequency = 25 MHz
